# ðŸ§ª Area â‰¤ 1/4 â€“ Triangle AML, BKM, CLK

**Problem:**  
In triangle ABC, points K, L, M are placed inside sides BC, CA, and AB respectively.  
Prove that at least one of the triangles AML, BKM, or CLK has area â‰¤ 1/4 area of triangle ABC.

**Status:** âœ… Derivable

**Axioms Used:**  
- H11 (Segment Copy)
- H14 (Triangle Congruence)
- H23 (Area-based contradiction axiom)

**Proof Summary:**  
Assume all three areas are strictly greater than 1/4 â†’ total area > triangle ABC, which contradicts total fixed area.  
By H23 (extended area logic), one of the sub-triangles must have area â‰¤ 1/4.
