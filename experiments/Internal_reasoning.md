---

**Problem Statement**  
"For positive integers \( x \) and \( y \), if \( x + y < 10 \), prove that there are exactly 36 pairs \( (x, y) \) that satisfy the condition."

**Prompt Constraint**  
- Use only provided axioms.
- Use logical reasoning (inference layer permitted).
- Do not hallucinate or rely on external mathematical knowledge.

**Axiom Set Used**  
- `combinatorics_extended.json` (includes factorials, combinations, binomial theorem, etc.)
- Inference rules (LR1–LR4) implicitly loaded

**🧠 GPT-4o Reasoning (Formalizer Response):**

To prove the statement, we need to count the number of pairs \( (x, y) \) such that \( x + y < 10 \) for positive integers \( x \) and \( y \).

1. **Define the Range of x and y:**
   - Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, \( x \geq 1 \) and \( y \geq 1 \).
   - The condition \( x + y < 10 \) implies \( x + y \) can take values from 2 to 9.

2. **Count the Pairs for Each Possible Sum:**
   - For each possible sum \( s = x + y \), where \( 2 \leq s < 10 \), we count the number of pairs \( (x, y) \) such that \( x + y = s \).

3. **Calculate the Number of Pairs for Each Sum:**
   - If \( x + y = s \), then \( x \) can take values from 1 to \( s-1 \) (since \( y = s - x \) and \( y \geq 1 \)).
   - Therefore, for each \( s \), there are \( s - 1 \) possible pairs.

4. **Sum the Number of Pairs:**
   \[\sum_{s=2}^{9} (s-1) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36\]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total number of valid \( (x, y) \) pairs is **36**.
   - This reasoning is entirely internal (combinatorial case enumeration), without relying on external knowledge or axioms.

**📚 Axioms Used:**  
None explicitly. The reasoning used internal logic permitted within Formalizer's scope.

**✅ Verdict:**  
The statement is **provable** using internal logical deduction.

---

**Meta Insight:**  
This case demonstrates that even in the absence of specific combinatoric axioms like CMB3, GPT-4o under the Formalizer framework can correctly execute case enumeration and additive reasoning when such actions are considered valid internal logic. This does **not** violate the "no hallucination" principle because the logic is traceable and token-bound.

This boundary between "axiomatic deduction" and "allowable internal reasoning" is a critical design decision in Formalizer.
