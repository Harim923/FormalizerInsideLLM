# 6-Point Line Geometry – Area of Triangle BGE (Undecidable)

**Problem:**  
Six points A, B, C, D, E, and F lie in a straight line in that order.  
Let G be a point not on the line.  
Given: AC = 26, BD = 22, CE = 31, DF = 33, AF = 73, CG = 40, DG = 30.  
Find the area of triangle BGE using only the given axioms.

**Reasoning (GPT-4o):**  
Undecidable.

---

**Axiom Trace:** `[]`  
**Result:** ❌ **Undecidable**

This shows that without area or projection axioms,  
Formalizer correctly halts when reasoning is not justified.
