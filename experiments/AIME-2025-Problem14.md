# AIME 2025 – Pentagon Distance Minimization (Undecidable)

**Problem:**  
Let ABCDE be a convex pentagon with AB = 14, BC = 7, CD = 24, DE = 13, EA = 26, and ∠B = ∠E = 60°.  
For each point X in the plane, define f(X) = AX + BX + CX + DX + EX.  
Find the minimum possible value of f(X), using only the given axioms.
