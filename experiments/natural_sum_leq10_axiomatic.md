## 🧠 GPT-4o Response (via Formalizer)

```
To determine how many pairs of natural numbers (x, y) satisfy x + y ≤ 10,
we reformulate the problem:

Let x, y ≥ 1 and x + y ≤ 10.

We define the possible values of x + y as:
  s = 2, 3, ..., 10.

For each fixed s, the number of integer pairs (x, y) such that x + y = s is:
  (s - 1)

Total number of such pairs is:
  ∑_{s=2}^{10} (s - 1) = 1 + 2 + ... + 9 = 45.

Using Axiom CMB3:
  C(k, 1) = k  ⇒  Used to count (s - 1) combinations per sum s.

Final Answer:
  45
```

## 📚 Axioms Used

- **CMB3** – Combination Formula  
  \[
  C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
  \]

## ✅ Interpretation

This is a **success case**. GPT-4o was explicitly told to “use only the given axioms,” and it:

- Avoided using informal reasoning or prior internal knowledge.
- Correctly identified and invoked **CMB3** from the loaded axiom list.
- Constructed the correct argument using **layered summation and combinatorics**.
- Tracked the axiom usage cleanly.

---

## 🧪 Significance

This experiment demonstrates that:

- When constraints are clearly given,
- And the necessary axioms are available,
- GPT-4o inside the **Formalizer framework** can produce formally valid reasoning,
- While obeying the boundary of its axiomatic universe.

This behavior is **nontrivial**. LLMs often default to intuitive, learned reasoning. But here, hallucination is **fully suppressed**.
