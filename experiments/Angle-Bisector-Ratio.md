# Angle Bisector – Ratio (Decidable Case)

**Problem:**  
In triangle ABC, AB = 5, AC = 7, and AD is the angle bisector of ∠BAC,  
with D lying on BC. Using only the given axioms, find the ratio BD : DC.

**Reasoning (GPT-4o):**

Axiom S7 states:  
In triangle ABC, if AD is the angle bisector of ∠BAC and D lies on BC,  
then \(\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC}\).

Given:
- AB = 5
- AC = 7

By applying S7 (using LR1), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{5}{7}
\]

So, the ratio BD : DC is **5 : 7**.
