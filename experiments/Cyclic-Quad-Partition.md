# 🧪 Partitioning a Cyclic Quadrilateral into n Cyclic Quadrilaterals

**Problem:**  
Prove that if n ≥ 4, every cyclic quadrilateral can be dissected into n quadrilaterals,  
each of which is also cyclic.

**Status:** ⏸ Undecidable

**Axioms Used:**  
- H1–H20 (Hilbert core geometry)

**Explanation:**  
Although decomposition strategies were explored,  
the current axiom set lacks a mechanism to preserve cyclicity under arbitrary quadrilateral partitioning.  
No derivable rule to guarantee cyclic property propagation → system halts.

**Result:**  
Formalizer(previously known as ProofGPT) declares this problem undecidable under the current axiom framework.
