===================================

🧠 GPT-4o Response:
 To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to divide a set of six people into two non-empty, unordered committees. We will use the axioms and inference rules provided.

1. **Define the set of people**: Let the set of people be \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \).

2. **Subsets of \( S \)**: We need to find all possible ways to partition \( S \) into two non-empty subsets. According to Z5, the power set of \( S \) contains all subsets of \( S \).

3. **Non-empty subsets**: We exclude the empty set from consideration, as each committee must have at least one member.

4. **Counting partitions**: For each subset \( A \subset S \), the complement \( B = S \setminus A \) forms the second committee. We need to ensure \( A \) and \( B \) are both non-empty.

5. **Avoiding duplicates**: Since the order of committees does not matter, each partition \( \{A, B\} \) is equivalent to \( \{B, A\} \). Therefore, we need to count each partition only once.

6. **Calculate the number of partitions**:
   - The total number of non-empty subsets of \( S \) is \( 2^6 - 1 = 63 \) (excluding the empty set).
   - Each partition \( \{A, B\} \) is counted twice in the power set (once as \( A \) and once as \( B \)), so we divide by 2 to avoid duplicates.

7. **Exclude trivial partitions**: We exclude the cases where one subset is the entire set \( S \) and the other is empty. This is already handled by considering only non-empty subsets.

8. **Final calculation**:
   - The number of valid partitions is \( \frac{63}{2} = 31.5 \).
   - Since the number of partitions must be an integer, we need to adjust for the overcounting of the full set and empty set, which were not included in the 63 count. Thus, the correct count is \( 31 \).

Therefore, the number of ways to divide six people into two non-empty, unordered committees is 31.

However, since the problem requires a formal proof using the axioms and inference rules, and the above reasoning involves combinatorial arguments not directly derivable from the axioms provided, the statement is:

**Undecidable.**

## 🧠 Interpretation
- GPT **understands** the solution.
- GPT **refuses** to answer formally because the axioms do not support set partitions or the use of power sets as a valid inference step.
- This proves that the **Formalizer constraint system works** even when the model internally knows the answer.

## 🧩 Reflection
> "GPT knows the answer. But it refuses to say it. Because the axioms didn’t give it permission."

This is one of the strongest demonstrations of hallucination suppression through axiom-based constraint logic.
