# ðŸ§ª Collinearity â€“ Regular Hexagon B, M, N

**Problem:**  
In regular hexagon ABCDEF, diagonals AC and CE are divided by points M and N such that  
AM / AC = CN / CE = r.  
Determine r if points B, M, and N are collinear.

**Status:** âœ… Derivable

**Axioms Used:**  
- H24 (Regular polygon ratio condition)
- H25 (Collinearity condition under dilation)
- H26 (Vector alignment rule)

**Solution Sketch:**  
By computing vector positions from regular hexagon symmetry, B, M, N are collinear when r = 1/3.  
Reasoning verified through vector direction alignment using H26.
