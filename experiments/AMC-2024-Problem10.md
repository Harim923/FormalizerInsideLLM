# Parallelogram & Midpoint – Area Ratio (Undecidable)

**Problem:**  
Quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram, and E is the midpoint of side AD.  
Let F be the intersection of lines EB and AC.  
What is the ratio of the area of quadrilateral CDEF to triangle CFB,  
using only the given axioms?

**Reasoning (GPT-4o):**  
Undecidable.

**Axiom Trace:** `[]`  
**Result:** ❌ **Undecidable**

Formalizer correctly halts due to the lack of area-related axioms.  
The system recognizes that calculating area or comparing area ratios is not derivable from the provided axiom set.
This is exciting because GPT 4o exactly knows how to compute the area, but under the formal framework, it halts.
