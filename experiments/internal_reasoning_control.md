# 🧠 Can GPT's Internal Reasoning Be Controlled?

One of the core achievements of **FormalizerInsideLLM** is its demonstrated ability to **limit internal reasoning** within a large language model like GPT-4o.

## 🔒 Problem: Hallucination from Unrestricted Reasoning

Traditional LLMs like GPT-3.5 or even GPT-4 (chat) are powerful but often suffer from:

- ❌ Hallucinating unproven or unprovable claims  
- ❌ "Knowing too much" and bypassing provided constraints  
- ❌ Using prior training knowledge even when it shouldn't

---

## ✅ Formalizer’s Approach: Restriction by Axioms + Meta-Rules

Formalizer introduces a **constrained reasoning environment**, where the LLM is bound to:

1. Only reason from **explicitly given axioms**
2. Apply **inference rules** if and only if they are listed
3. Halt with `"Undecidable"` if no valid path exists

---

## 🔁 Prompt-Level Control

In the system prompt, we declare:

```
You must not use any external knowledge not explicitly listed in the axioms or rules.
You may not assume or calculate anything outside the axioms.
```

Combined with structured input like:
```json
"meta_rules": {
  "external_knowledge_allowed": false,
  "must_halt_if_undecidable": true
}
```

the model **halts its reasoning** if axioms are insufficient — **even if the problem is easy.**

---

## 🎯 Example Behavior

### ❌ Without axioms:
**Problem**: "How many natural number pairs (x, y) satisfy x + y < 10?"  
**Response**: `"Undecidable."`

### ✅ With axioms like CMB3 (combinations):
**Same problem, but now with axioms about counting**  
**Response**: A complete proof using only provided axioms.

---

## 🤯 Why This Matters

- LLMs can now be used as **formal assistants**, not just fluent talkers  
- We can now **trace, log, and verify** the origin of every inference  
- It's the first time we see GPT **stop thinking** due to logical constraints  
- Enables **teaching tools**, **automated grading**, **legal/medical reasoning**, and more

> 🔐 **Conclusion**:  
> With proper framework design and meta-constraint layering,  
> GPT’s internal reasoning can be controlled — reliably, measurably, and safely.
